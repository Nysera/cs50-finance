# CS50 Finance
CS50 Finance is a stock trading website which was created to practice Python, Flask and SQL for the [CS50 week 9 problem set.](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/9/finance/)

The original project used bootstrap and also used a separate error page for form errors, instead I removed bootstrap and used flask flash for errors and success messages instead.
